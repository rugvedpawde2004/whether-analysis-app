# Analyze_Weather_Data

# Project Overview
The Analyze Weather Data project focuses on examining and visualizing weather data from Pune to identify patterns, seasonal trends, and extreme weather events. This includes:

- Aggregating data by time periods such as months.
- Visualizing trends in temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
- Highlighting significant weather events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Understand weather patterns and seasonal trends in Pune.
- Identify and analyze extreme weather events.
- Provide insights through data visualizations.

# Dataset and Tools
Dataset: Pune Weather Data (pune_weather_with_regions.csv)

Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

# References:
- Official documentation of the libraries used.
- Resources on weather data analysis and visualization.

# Key Steps in Analysis
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
- Loaded the dataset and converted the date column to a datetime format.
- Added a "month" column for monthly grouping.
2. Data Aggregation:
- Calculated average values for temperature, humidity, and rainfall by month.
- Classified extreme weather events (e.g., heatwaves and heavy rainfall).
3. Data Visualization:
- Line plots for temperature and rainfall trends.
- Bar charts for average monthly rainfall.
- Scatter plots for extreme weather events.
- Interactive plots for exploring regional trends.
- Facet grids for region-specific temperature trends.

# Code Highlights
- Data Preprocessing: Converting date formats and aggregating monthly data.
  
- Visualization:
-- Line plots for trends.
-- Bar charts for rainfall.
-- Scatter plots for extreme events.
-- Interactive visualizations using Plotly.

- Extreme Weather Analysis:
-- Identified multi-day heatwaves and heavy rainfall events.
-- Highlighted trends across regions using interactive and static plots.

# Results
1. Monthly Trends:
- Seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall were observed.
- Identified significant weather events plotted on timelines.
2. Extreme Events:
- Detected multi-day heatwaves and heavy rainfall across regions.
- Highlighted regions with higher occurrences of extreme events.
3. Interactive Insights:
- Provided detailed exploration capabilities with interactive visualizations.

# Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed Pune's weather data, revealing patterns, seasonal trends, and extreme weather events. The insights can aid in better understanding local weather behavior and preparing for adverse conditions.

Future Work:

Incorporating predictive modeling using machine learning to forecast weather events
